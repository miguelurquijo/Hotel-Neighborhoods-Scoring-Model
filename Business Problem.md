<h1 align="center"><b>HOTEL NEIGHBORHOODS SCORING MODEL</b></h>

<h2><b>Introduction</h2></b>

<p align="justify">Selina is a hospitality network wich plans to expand from 70 locations up to 400 locations worldwide by 2024. One of the main challenges of this expansion is to determine which are the neighborhoods that will yield higher occupancy rates in each city. Currently, this analysis is done throught experts opinions in each city but finding and forming relationships with local experts is a high cost and time investment that presents a challenge to the expansion goals of Selina.</p>

<h2><b>Solution</h2></b>

<p align="justify">This project aims to create a neighborhood scoring model that enables Selina to determine the neighborhoods that will yield the best occupancy rates in each city. This will require 2 main steps:

1. To find patterns in existing Selina locations surroundings venues to determine how they impact the occupancy rates of open locations
2. To find neighborhoods that match those patterns in cities were Selina is planning to expand.</p>


<h2><b>Data</h2></b>

<p align="justify"> The data required for the scoring model is:

1. Average Occupancy Rate Per Selina DB. This database will need to be constructed for this project. 
 
2. Foursquare. The number of restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, and night clubs in each neighborhood, as well as their ratings and number of reviews, will be needed to determine the patterns that will predict higher occupancy rates locations. 

3. This model will be tested in 2-3 cities. A dataset with all the neighborhoods of these cities will be required.</p>
